## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install an [Prometheus JMX Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) server in a Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.4.5.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-hostmanager)) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```yml
- src: idealista.prometheus_jmx_exporter-role
  version: 1.0.0
  name: prometheus_jmx_exporter
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```yml
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: prometheus_jmx_exporter
```

## Usage

Look to the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) properties file to see the possible configuration properties.

### Providing custom configuration

Starting from role version 2.x.x, in order to provide custom JMX Exporter configuration, set `jmx_exporter_config_template_path` to the template in your playbook that is the configuration file. For example: 

```yml
jmx_exporter_config_template_path: "{{ playbook_dir }}/templates/jmx_exporter/config/jmx_config.yml"
```

In previous versions, this variable pointed to a **folder** instead of a **file**. If you are using this role since version 1.x, you may check our [migration guide](https://github.com/idealista/prometheus_jmx_exporter-role/wiki#v1x-to-v2-migration-guide)

## Testing

```sh
pipenv install -r test-requirements.txt --python 2.7
pipenv run molecule test -s default
```
